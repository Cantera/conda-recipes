This repository hosts the recipe to build the Python interface for Cantera into a `conda` package. The package is built on GitHub Actions and uploaded to the `cantera` channel on [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/search?q=cantera) automatically.

**Important:** the `conda-forge` recipe is maintained in a separate repository ([conda-forge/cantera-feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/cantera-feedstock)).
